# Ridge regresssion 
## Why Use Ridge Regression?
Overfitting Prevention: By adding a penalty to the size of the coefficients, Ridge regression can reduce overfitting, especially when dealing with multicollinearity or when the number of features is large compared to the number of observations.
Stability: The regularization term stabilizes the regression coefficients, making the model less sensitive to changes in the training data.



Ridge regression, also known as Tikhonov regularization, is a technique used to create a linear regression model that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting. The equation for Ridge regression includes both the standard linear regression terms and a regularization term.

### Equation for Ridge Regression

The objective function for Ridge regression is to minimize the following equation:

Here:
- \( y_i \) is the actual value of the target variable for the \(i\)th observation.
- \( \mathbf{x}_i \) is the feature vector for the \(i\)th observation.
- \( \mathbf{w} \) is the vector of coefficients (weights).
- \( b \) is the intercept term.
- \( \alpha \) is the regularization parameter (also known as the penalty term).
- \( n \) is the number of observations.
- \( p \) is the number of features.

### Components of the Equation

1. **Loss Function (Residual Sum of Squares)**:

   - This part represents the sum of squared differences between the actual values and the predicted values. It's the same as the loss function in ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression.

2. **Regularization Term (L2 Norm)**:

   - This part penalizes large coefficients by adding a term proportional to the sum of the squares of the coefficients. The regularization parameter \( \alpha \) controls the strength of the penalty. When \( \alpha = 0 \), Ridge regression becomes ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.

### Normalization in Ridge Regression

Normalization (or standardization) of features is crucial before applying Ridge regression because it ensures that all features contribute equally to the regularization term. Without normalization, features with larger scales could dominate the penalty term, leading to biased coefficient estimates. In your code, this was done using `StandardScaler`:

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### Ridge Regression Model in Your Code

In your code, the Ridge regression model was created and trained as follows:

```python
# Create and train the Ridge regression model
model = Ridge(alpha=0.5)  # You can tune alpha for regularization strength
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
```

Here, `alpha=0.5` is the regularization parameter, which controls the trade-off between fitting the data perfectly (high variance) and keeping the coefficients small (low variance). Adjusting `alpha` allows you to fine-tune the model's complexity and generalization ability.


The regularization term in Ridge regression, also known as the **L2 penalty**, is crucial for controlling the model complexity and preventing overfitting. Let's delve into its specifics:

### Regularization Term (L2 Penalty)

The regularization term in Ridge regression is given by:

![image](https://github.com/akhileshj2004/covid19analysisEDA/assets/168991836/8ecf14b8-7e0b-4a80-bec7-d2c9e63245b7)


where:
- \( \alpha \) is the regularization parameter (also called the penalty term).
- \( w_j \) is the coefficient (weight) for the \( j \)-th feature.
- \( p \) is the number of features.

### Purpose of the Regularization Term

1. **Prevent Overfitting**: By penalizing large coefficients, the regularization term discourages the model from fitting the noise in the training data, thus improving its generalization to unseen data.
2. **Control Model Complexity**: The term ensures that the model does not become too complex by keeping the coefficients small.
3. **Handle Multicollinearity**: In cases where features are highly correlated (multicollinearity), Ridge regression can help stabilize the coefficient estimates.

### How the Regularization Term Works

- **When \( \alpha = 0 \)**: The regularization term vanishes, and Ridge regression reduces to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The model will attempt to minimize only the residual sum of squares (RSS) without any penalty on the size of the coefficients.

- **When \( \alpha > 0 \)**: The model minimizes both the RSS and the L2 penalty term. The regularization term adds a constraint to the optimization, shrinking the coefficients toward zero but not making them exactly zero (unless \( \alpha \) is very large).

### Effectiveness Compared to Other Models

- **Ridge Regression vs. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**: Ridge regression is more effective in preventing overfitting, especially when the number of features is large or when there is multicollinearity among the features.
- **Ridge Regression vs. Lasso Regression**: While Ridge regression (L2 penalty) shrinks all coefficients uniformly, Lasso regression (L1 penalty) can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection. Ridge is preferred when you believe all features contribute to the outcome, while Lasso is useful for sparse solutions.
- **Ridge Regression vs. Elastic Net**: Elastic Net combines both L1 and L2 penalties, benefiting from the properties of both Ridge and Lasso. It is useful when you expect some level of sparsity and multicollinearity.
