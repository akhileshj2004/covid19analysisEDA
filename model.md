# Certainly! Let's go through the provided code step-by-step to understand its functionality:

### Step 1: Importing Necessary Libraries
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
```
These lines import essential functions and classes from scikit-learn for data splitting, model creation, feature scaling, and evaluation metrics.

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
```python
# Strip whitespace from column names
data.columns = data.columns.str.strip()

# Drop rows with missing values in the relevant columns
data = data.dropna(subset=['Total Doses Administered', 'First Dose Administered', 'Second Dose Administered'])
```
- The first line removes any leading or trailing whitespace from column names to avoid issues with column referencing.
- The second line removes rows with missing values in the specified columns to ensure the model has complete data for training and testing.

### Step 3: Define Features and Target Variable
```python
# Define the features (independent variables) and target (dependent variable)
X = data[['First Dose Administered', 'Second Dose Administered']]
y = data['Total Doses Administered']
```
- `X` contains the independent variables (features) which are 'First Dose Administered' and 'Second Dose Administered'.
- `y` contains the dependent variable (target) which is 'Total Doses Administered'.

### Step 4: Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
```python
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```
This splits the dataset into training and testing sets with 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. The `random_state` ensures reproducibility of the split.

### Step 5: Feature Scaling
```python
# Scale the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```
- A `StandardScaler` is used to standardize the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
- The scaler is fitted on the training data and then applied to both the training and testing data.

### Step 6: Create and Train Ridge Regression Model
```python
# Create and train the Ridge regression model
model = Ridge(alpha=0.5)  # You can tune alpha for regularization strength
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
```
- A Ridge regression model is instantiated with an alpha value of 0.5, which controls the regularization strength.
- The model is trained (fitted) on the scaled training data.

### Step 7: Make Predictions and Evaluate the Model
```python
# Make predictions on the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
```
- Predictions are made on the scaled testing data.
- The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R^2) score, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### Step 8: Display Model Coefficients and Intercept
```python
# Display the coefficients
coefficients = model.coef_
intercept = model.intercept_

print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
print(f'R^2 Score: {r2}')
print(f'Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): {rmse}')
print(f'Coefficients: {coefficients}')
print(f'Intercept: {intercept}')
```
The model's coefficients and intercept are displayed, showing the learned parameters.

### Step 9: Example Prediction
```python
# Example prediction
new_data = pd.DataFrame({'First Dose Administered': [10], 'Second Dose Administered': [5]})
new_data_scaled = scaler.transform(new_data)
predicted_doses = model.predict(new_data_scaled)
print(f'Predicted Total Doses Administered for First Dose=10 and Second Dose=5: {predicted_doses[0]}')
```
An example prediction is made using the model to predict the total doses administered for a given set of first and second doses.

### Step 10: Calculate and Print RMSE as Percentage of Standard Deviation
```python
# Calculate the standard deviation of the target variable
std_dev = y_test.std()

# Print RMSE as a percentage of the standard deviation
print(f'Standard Deviation of Target Variable: {std_dev}')
print(f'RMSE as a percentage of Standard Deviation: {rmse / std_dev * 100:.2f}%')
```
The standard deviation of the target variable is calculated, and the RMSE is expressed as a percentage of this standard deviation to provide a sense of the prediction error relative to the variability of the data.

## Output -
- Mean Squared Error: 3.144815362054022e-05
- R^2 Score: 0.9997321451240524
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.005607865335449864
- Coefficients: [0.27663828 0.06650932]
- Intercept: 0.25323948944390806
- Predicted Total Doses Administered for First Dose=10 and Second Dose=5: 9.101932175919794
- Standard Deviation of Target Variable: 0.3427599332588373
- RMSE as a percentage of Standard Deviation: 1.64%
 
### Summary:
- The code performs data preprocessing, including stripping whitespace from column names and handling missing values.
- It defines features and the target variable, splits the data, and scales the features.
- A Ridge regression model is created and trained on the scaled data.
- The model's performance is evaluated, and predictions are made for new data.
- The results, including evaluation metrics and model coefficients, are displayed. 

Normalization ensures that features contribute equally to the model, and Ridge regression helps in dealing with multicollinearity and improves generalization by adding a penalty to large coefficients.
