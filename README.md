analyze the distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines across different states in India

### Coronaviruses, a diverse group of viruses, can lead to illnesses in both animals and humans. In humans, these viruses can cause a range of respiratory infections, from mild colds to more serious conditions like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The newest addition to this family of viruses is the one responsible for the COVID-19 disease, as identified by the World Health Organization.

### We aim to analyze the distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines across different states in India. It seeks to uncover regional disparities, assess vaccination rates, understand demographic trends, address challenges, and predict future vaccine needs. By doing so, the project aims to provide actionable insights to optimize vaccine deployment strategies and combat the pandemic effectively.
