# Data Loading:
Dataset format: CSV 
Load dataframe as data, using pandas library
Dataset type: Time Series

# Data Cleaning:
Replace null values with median
Drop 3 attributes because of 97% null values
Drop 200 rows due to inconsistent data!

# Data Exploration:
Calculated Central tendency measures
Calculate number of distinct values
Calculate Duplicate rows

# Outlier Detection:
Boxplot to detect outliers
Capping used to handle Outliers in IQR 

# Encoding Technique:
Applied label Encoding on ”Updated on” and ”States”  Attributes to transform Categorical attributes to numerical attributes

# Skewness and Normalization:  
Calculated skew value and KDE plot to determine the skewness
Applied min-max normalization for model implementation

# Correlation Analysis: 
Plot Heat map for Correlation Analysis

# Data Visualization:  
Donut Chart
Bar plot
Stacked bar plot
Multiple histogram
Gauge plot
Choreopleath map
Scatter plot

# Ridge Regression :
## is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term. The regularization term helps to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients in the model. This is particularly useful in scenarios where:
Mean Squared Error: 3.144815362054088e-05
R^2 Score: 0.9997321451240523
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.005607865335449923
Coefficients: [0.27663828 0.06650932]
Intercept: 0.25323948944390806
Standard Deviation of Target Variable: 0.3427599332588373
RMSE as a percentage of Standard Deviation: 1.64%
